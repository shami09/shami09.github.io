Hello! I‚Äôm **Shamika Likhite**, a Software Engineer (Machine Learning) at **Speechace, LLC**.  

At Speechace, I focus on developing and enhancing **machine learning models for our Writing Assessment API**, with work spanning both ML engineering and data engineering. My contributions aim to organize, optimize, and advance the speech and writing assessment capabilities of Speechace. Specifically, I design **machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) solutions** to address real-world challenges in text analysis and audio processing. These applications are widely deployed but often face hurdles related to data quality and model robustness. My goal is to build **reliable, efficient algorithms** that perform well in resource-constrained environments while maintaining high accuracy.  

Beyond writing assessment, I am deeply interested in **multimodal learning for NLP**‚Äîdeveloping models that integrate speech, text, and video to improve robustness, interpretability, and real-world applicability of natural language systems. 

My broader research interests lie in **long-context multimodal LLM reasoning**‚Äîdeveloping methods that allow large language models to effectively integrate and reason across multiple modalities (speech, text, video) over extended contexts. I am particularly interested in approaches that enhance **robustness, interpretability, and efficiency** in these systems.  

Before joining Speechace, I worked as a **Research Assistant at Northwestern University‚Äôs [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/)**. There, I developed a **multimodal model for speech disfluency detection** at the [Ideas Lab](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu/), focusing on robustness to missing modalities. I also contributed to **video super-resolution research** at the [Image and Video Processing Lab (IVPL)](https://sites.northwestern.edu/ivpl/).  

I hold a **Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering** from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).  

üìß You can reach me at shamikalikhite2024 [at] u [dot] northwestern [dot] edu.

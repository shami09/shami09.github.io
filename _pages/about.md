Hello! Iâ€™m Shamika, a Software Engineer (Machine Learning) at Speechace, LLC.

At Speechace, I focus on developing and enhancing machine learning models for our Writing Assessment API. My work spans both ML engineering and data engineering, aimed at organizing, optimizing, and advancing the speech and writing assessment capabilities of Speechace.

At Speechace, my work focuses on developing and enhancing a Writing Assessment application using advanced Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. I design machine learning solutions to address real-world challenges in text analysis and audio processing. These applications are widely used but often face hurdles related to data quality and model robustness. My goal is to build reliable algorithms that can effectively operate in resource-constrained environments while maintaining high performance.

Before joining Speechace, I worked as a Research Assistant at Northwestern University's [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/), where I developed a multimodal model for speech disfluency detection at the [Ideas Lab](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu/), focusing on multimodal learning and robustness to missing modalities. I also contributed to video super-resolution research at the Image and Video Processing Lab [IVPL](https://sites.northwestern.edu/ivpl/). I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).
